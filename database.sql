We’ll study other cities from around the country to find models for Minneapolis to mirror, or avoid. In this topic, Minneapolitans will come together and help us finalize solutions for our public town hall and final policy product.

63	Who is Ensuring The Proper Infrastructure?	 This demographic change presents a number of challenges to current research infrastructure aimed at translating discoveries to improved human health. Key issues include the need to expand the workforce trained in aging research, development of specific resources and harmonization of measures and outcomes, and a culture change within the scientific community. In particular, complexity must be represented within research design and embraced as an important aspect of review panel critiques.	12	68
54	Preparing for a Growing Population	The health care system will need to prepare for the increasing incidences of chronic conditions within the aging population, as well as develop strategies to prevent falls. An important challenge is implementation of new approaches in health care delivery to address the changing health status of this aging population. With chronic conditions on the rise in this population, their health care becomes more complex. Focusing on a single disease rather than comorbidity can result in insufficient focus on other present medical conditions.	14	72
88	Who Will Fill the Gap?	With 75 million Baby Boomers marching inexorably toward retirement, it’s clear that employers will need more than one workforce plan for replacing exiting workers. \n\nFilling the workforce gap will be a challenge. The ranks of the Gen X workers are simply not enough, while many Millennials lack the needed work experience. Foreign-born workers often face immigration challenges, while flexible or remote workers aren’t appropriate for every role.	14	71
89	 Baby Boomers Affecting the Workplace	Baby Boomers are going to shake up your workplace dynamic? In a study conducted the AARP study, only half of working Boomers said they are in good or excellent health.  We can predict that companies will be spending more on employee sick pay, as well as health insurance and life insurance benefits.\n\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reports that older workers are less likely to have accidents on the job, but that when they do, their recovery tends to take longer. So, workers comp costs may also be impacted.	14	69
99	Who Will Take Care of My Mother?	The low birthrates of our younger generations mean that there will not, in future, be enough children or grandchildren around to take care of their parents or grandparents. If family members cannot do this, then who will? In Singapore, a special category of well-trained domestic helpers recruited from overseas helps with the daily needs of its elderly citizens. Might not a similar scheme be introduced here? I love my mother but don't have the time or experience to care for her as she ages. I need to feel comfortable that there will be structure in place in the future.	15	70
97	Not Everyone Will Retire	Another way to cover the skills gap is to retain your Baby Boomer employees on the job indefinitely. Be warned, however: Baby Boomer employees may say they plan to work into their 70s (or possibly forever), but by age 68, only 16 percent of people actually work full time (17 percent work part time), according to Gallup.\n\nYour best strategy may be to create a Boomer knowledge transfer and replacement program that focuses your senior employees on transferring their knowledge to others over a pre-retirement period of 12 to 18 months.	14	68
96	Who Will Pick up the Slack	According to Pew Research, Gen X contributes nearly 53 million workers to the U.S. economy. That leaves a gap of 10 million workers to fill the Baby Boomer gap. \n\nUnfortunately, not all Gen Xers will continue to work full time. Many in the “latchkey generation” are at a life stage with children and some must care for aging parents, too. For these workers, workplace flexibility and work/life balance are critical components of the decision to stay in, or step away from, the workforce.	14	70
100	Preparing Infrastructure	Minneapolis needs to prepare itself for the rise of the elderly!! High-traffic public space should be made more pedestrian-friendly (and thereby also more elderly-friendly) by strict enforcement against those shops which display their merchandise illegally on pavements.\n\nEvery staircase or set of steps in Minneapolis needs to have a handrail attached to help the elderly, and others, use them with greater ease and safety. This is a huge requirement which will take years to complete: All the more reason for starting on this task today!	12	71
50	Aging In Place	Cities do need to prepare for an older citizenry. A new report called “Ageing in Cities,” from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a membership group of 30-plus countries that focuses on the global economy, notes:\n\nIn OECD countries, the population share of those over 65 years old reached 17.8 percent in 2010, up from 7.7 percent in 1950, and is expected to climb to 25.1 percent in 2050. Cities are home to 43.2 percent of this older population. Minneapolis should start planning to accomodate for this growth.	12	69
58	Return on Investment	The state of current workforce and infrastructure available for translational research in aging, and suggests important changes that are required to further translational research in aging and the care of older adults. It is imperative that isolated illness be studied in the most appropriate models, that multi-morbidity be explicitly included rather than excluded, and that outcomes of value to older adults (e.g. functional independence, quality of life).	12	70
90	Transportation by Bus	Proper bus travel etiquette ought to be more aggressively promoted and enforced. Examples are legion of younger, able-bodied passengers inappropriately hogging the supposed “special needs’’ seats on public transport and being most reluctant to give them up, even when an elderly person is left standing nearby. More education on civic duties and better public manners should be introduced in schools, when young minds are more malleable, to rectify this disgraceful yet widespread problem.	12	71
101	Sustainable Development	Aging baby boomers want many of the same things as millennials. They want to be mobile and social, with easy access to bus stops, grocery stores, parks, pharmacies and hospitals,” noting, “that means cities and suburbs must adapt. Examining nine OECD cities specifically, from Philadelphia to Toyama, Japan, the report defines sustainable development trends and suggests policies — and points out that while there are challenges to adapting, there’s also opportunity.	12	69
56	Accomodations	When cities make an effort to accommodate “aging in place,” they typically end up with designs that benefit younger residents too.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nMapping of History of Cities Is Modern-Day Encyclopedia for Urbanists\nConfronting Urban Design’s Diversity Crisis With a Return to Black Places\nSidewalk Labs Spinoff Could Be Coming to Your City\nWhat a Massive Indian Festival Can Teach Us About Improving Cities\nLast summer, Next City contributor Jessica Kourkounis asked Philadelphia seniors, “How can your city change to accommodate older residents?”	12	64
104	Immigration to the Rescue	One reason the U.S. is in better shape is its comparatively high rate of immigration. Since people tend to migrate when they are younger, immigrants tend to bring down the age of the population as a whole. Moreover, at least in the U.S., immigrants tend to have a higher birth rate than the native-born population, although the gap has narrowed somewhat in recent years. The future direction of immigration, therefore, makes a big difference to the age breakdown of the U.S. population. 	14	64
106	Productivity as Innovation	Innovation could come to the rescue by boosting the productivity of the remaining labor force. If the more productive few can produce as much output as the less productive many, GDP will not fall. Similarly, with fewer but more productive workers in the population, per-capita GDP may stay constant. Innovation is the means; economic growth is the end.\n\nCan we plausibly expect aging societies to be as innovative as they need to be? Sociologists, policy makers, and cultural researchers tend to stress the hypothesis that old societies lose the spirit of enterprise, favor security over risky dynamism, and become less forward-looking.	16	72
105	Accessibility in New Construction	Accessibility is crucial. Design elements should include: single-floor living without stairs, doorways and hallways at least 36” wide, non-slip flooring with smooth thresholds between rooms, handrails, adequate lighting, lever-style door/faucet handles, higher toilets with extra space around for easier assistance, showers equipped with a bench, and multi-height kitchen countertops. For the exterior of the home, zero-step entrances, level driveways, weather-protected walkway and entrance, and low-maintenance landscaping should be considered.	13	71
111	Real Estate Implecations 	People currently over the age of 55 have saved only $150,000 for retirement, per Fidelity and Vanguard estimates. This savings amount will generate only $500 per month in income, if the recommended 4% withdrawal standard is followed. Social Security pays an average of $1,294 in benefits to retirees, so average monthly income will be $1,794 or $21,528 per year. If 34% – 38% is spent on housing, the average retiree will have a housing budget of $610 – $682 per month – 	13	1
102	Higher Quality Care for the Elderly	The scandalous treatment of some physically and mentally fragile residents in homes for the elderly is directly traceable to a serious shortage of such facilities, while families of abused residents are unwilling to file complaints because of difficulties in gaining admission to such places. Thus, far greater provision of affordable elderly care residential homes and daycare centers needs to be made. This should be matched by stricter official supervision of such homes to ensure compliance in the operation of such facilities.	15	1
94	A Sleeping Giant	When they retire, decades of experience go with them unless a company has plans in place so that their knowledge is inherited by Gen X and millennial employees.\n\n"It's one of those sleeping giants most people don't think about. They deal with it when someone leaves," said Andrew Pena, assistant vice president for human resources at New Mexico State University and author of several papers and articles on retaining corporate generational knowledge. If you don't do something proactively today, you're going to be stuck with employees who know basic tasks but don't have that institutional knowledge.	14	69
59	it's really not that bad	As bad as the U.S. demographics look, things are worse in much of the world. The U.S. has fewer residents over 65, as a share of its population, than most developed countries, and the disparity will only grow in coming decades. In 2050, about 21 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 or older compared to more than 30 percent in much of Western Europe and an incredible 40 percent in Japan. China, as a result of its “one child” policy, faces its own, somewhat different, demographic crisis.	14	72
53	Affordable Housing Boom	According to a report Opens a New Window. by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing, by 2035 more than one in five people in the U.S. will be aged 65 and older, and one in three households will be headed by someone in that age group. The Projections and Implications for Housing a Growing Population: Older Adults 2015-2035 report notes the growth will increase the demand for affordable, accessible housing that is well connected to services beyond what the current supply can meet.	13	71
87	Our Elderly Are Relying on Good Infrastructure	Minneapolis, with a growing senior population, is seeing an increase in the number of frail and disabled elderly who rely on local services and infrastructure and are concentrated in the inner cities and older suburbs. While local governments and institutions will face greater pressure to provide services and infrastructure to this expanding segment, the challenge may prove especially difficult for many upstate communities, given their environment of slow economic growth and fiscal stress.	12	72
52	Are Baby Boomers Buying or Renting?	It's not unusual for empty nesters to consider downsizing and avoiding tasks such as yard work. But typically downsizing has meant buying smaller homes or condos. Now, for a generation with a reputation for setting trends and yearning for freedom, an increasing number want to rent rather than own. Apartment living in Minneapolis frees up time spent on maintenance and they walk to restaurants, plays, movies and musical events. Could renting be a unique twist for many boomers, the sheer size of their generation starting households.	13	64
93	Homeownership	But homeownership among people 50 to 64 slipped 5 percentage points between 2005 and 2013, notes Molinsky. Part was driven by foreclosures and job loss in the recession. Others are "transitioning to renting as a choice," she said. They want "cost-effective options that demand less time, physical effort and money to maintain." As people enter their 70s, she expects the desire for ease and safety to intensify.\n\nThe combination of 8 million foreclosures and a 10 percent unemployment rate during the housing crash and Great Recession sparked a surge in rentals among all age groups during the last few years and has caused rental rates to soar. 	13	68
57	Zoning Regulations	Most housing regulations are controlled at the local level and range from zoning restrictions to building codes, which can become impediments to building new housing for seniors.  Minneapolis has started implementing these changes which has led to a shortage of housing and run-away inflation in housing costs. City plans, zoning regulations and building codes should be reviewed to address the growing elderly population, in addition to transportation, healthcare, and financial assistance/incentives.	13	70
92	Financial Assistance	Governments may need to consider offering financial assistance to low-income older adult renters, and incentive programs for safe and senior-friendly renovations, energy efficient home upgrades, and property tax relief. Affordability will be key, since more than half of all boomers have less than $100,000 saved for retirement. Public awareness and education is needed to encourage older adults to consider their future housing needs earlier in life. What does this mean for the real estate industry as a whole?	13	72
98	Luxury Living	Although luxury buildings in downtown Minneapolis have been especially popular with empty nesters craving activity, Ramella said boomers are also renting near suburban areas where they raised families. They want to continue ties with churches and communities, he said.\n\nRenting in Minneapolis's downtown is beyond the typical boomer's budget. The new luxury buildings in Minneapolis run about $2.81 a square foot, or $2,800 for 1,000 square feet, according to Appraisal Research Counselors. Many units are 700 to 800 square feet and are geared toward single millennials. Boomers typically want larger apartments.	13	69
60	Transforming Healthcare	With waves of boomers getting older and incurring multiple chronic conditions, hospitals will take on more of the financial burden. "They drive hospital costs," says Richard Birkel, senior vice president for the Center for Healthy Aging and director, Self-Management Alliance at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit service and advocacy group. "People with multiple chronic conditions are much more likely to end up in the hospital, as a result of a fall, as a result of a cold, getting the flu. They are walking on a tightrope, and they are more vulnerable and, therefore, are much more expensive."	15	68
86	Illnesses and Elderly	One of the biggest stress points is sure to be the care of the chronically ill, already a struggle for the Medicare program, particularly regarding patients with multiple chronic conditions.\n\n"The reality is most elderly people do not have one disease on their death certificates," says Daniel Perry, president of the Alliance for Aging Research. Multiple conditions usually require care from more than one specialist in addition to a primary care physician, and the system currently is set up in a way that doesn't encourage coordination and collaboration. With that many new people enrolling in Medicare.	15	1
61	Is Privatisation the Answer?	Privatisation, public-private partnerships and private initiatives will play a key role in absorbing the pressure on public finances and social systems.\n\nPrivate-sector entities must be made aware of the challenges facing them as the labour pool shrinks. Demand for less qualified staff is likely to continue to fall in the future, making it unrealistic to hope that the problem of unemployment will be solved by demographic change. The competition for highly qualified employees (“war for talents”) is likely to become more intense and inflate salaries for this group. The impact of the demographic shift will be wide-ranging, leading to changes.	16	72
128	Millennials vs. Baby Boomers	Back in 1960, only one in five young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 were actually living with their parents.  But, a Pew Research Center study found that in 2014, 32.1% of Millennials lived in their parents home.\n\n“They’re very happy to stay at home and live off the bank of mom and dad and they put off having children, getting married, so everything was later,” Douglas Elliman CEO Dottie Herman told the FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.\n\nBut there has been a recent shift in Millennials’ impact on the housing market.	13	64

10	Aging Minnesota	Minnesota is in a precarious spot with its population. According to the Minnesota State Demographic Center, “In the present decade (2010-2015), the counties that were entirely rural or a rural/town mix (as a group) have seen population losses, while counties that were entirely or partially urban (as a group) saw gains. Entirely urban counties, however, were the only county type growing as a result of migration (not due to births) and only due to international arrivals, ultimately.” Additionally, about 73 percent of Minnesotans now live in urban areas. Furthermore, Minnesota is facing an unprecedented increase in Minnesota’s “older adult” population which means Minnesota will also need to rely on international migration to fill labor force shortages.	t	f
